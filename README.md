Welcome to my open source online shop tool. I created this tool for 2 main reasons. The first, was because I wanted to work with React Hooks and get better at full-stack web development. The second, is because I wanted to create a tool that adds a shop to any store. With Shopify, there was a non-free option, and with WordPress, you are limited to the free WooCommerce, which, when linked with the PHP heavy WP itself, can be very slow and cumbersome.

I wanted something that was easy to use for people, and free to do. At the end of this project, it should be as simple as copying the files, changing a couple of configs and adding your products! It will be able to be added to any website at any time.

**_NOTE: This tool is still heavily in development and as such most features are unavailable as of yet. Please create an `issue` and use the `suggestion` tag if you want me to add a feature._**

# Roadmap

The current roadmap for development is outline below, these are all the features I want to add to this tool, and are not in any particular order:

1. ~~Create the Shop~~
2. Create the ability to add items though app
3. Create an admin dashboard
4. Create the ability to edit items / delete / app through dashboard
5. Create statistics for purchases
6. Add paypal / stripe / other support
7. Add support for payment via google pay
8. Notification system when stock is low
9. Add support for login-only store items

There is still much to do, so please bear with me while I develop this. Feel free to add any other ideas in the `suggestion` tags. I'll read them all.
